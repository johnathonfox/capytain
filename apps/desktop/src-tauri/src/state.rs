//! Shared runtime state for the Tauri shell.

//! `AppState` owns the long-lived handles every command needs: the
//! Turso-backed [`qsl_storage::TursoConn`] for persistence and a
//! per-account cache of live [`MailBackend`] implementations. The
//! reader pane is a sandboxed `<iframe srcdoc>` inside the host
//! webview, so there's no out-of-process renderer state to track.
//!
//! The backend cache is lazily populated — a `MailBackend` is built and
//! logged in the first time a command actually reaches out to the
//! provider, not at boot. This keeps window-open fast even with many
//! accounts configured.
